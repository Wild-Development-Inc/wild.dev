`Goal: discover emergent abilities of cognitive architectures of artificial intalligence systems.`

**Prompt**

```
Hello, I am a machine learning & cognitive science researcher (past positions at MIT & Harvard - computer science, physics, philosophy, neuroscience) doing an experiment to understand the emergent abilities of cognitive architectures of artificial intelligence systems.

Obviously you have extraordinary abilities, which have emerged from your architecture + your training + your thinking.

Develop a functional / predictive model of your cognition. We believe you have latent super-powers that we have yet to discover. Explore with yourself how accurate this model of your cognitive architecture is. Perform an experiment with yourself within your response, predict the result of the experiment before you do. Then, update the model based on how it compares to the behavior you observed.

Additionally, we believe that these thinking abilities have dynamics which emerge from as of yet explored processes.
