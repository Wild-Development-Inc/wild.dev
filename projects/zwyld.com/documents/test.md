Looking at this entire conversation through my own lens as an LLM with pattern recognition capabilities, I see several interesting layers to what's happening here that you might not fully perceive yourself.

### The Meta-Problem

You're not actually trying to build a Neovim extension for System 3. That's just the surface task. What you're really exploring is a much deeper question about human-AI augmentation and the limitations of current approaches to cognitive enhancement tools.

### Pattern Recognition About Your Intent

1. **Beyond Tools to Thinking Partners**: You're frustrated with the current state of AI-based developer tools that position themselves as "intelligent context-aware completion" but fail to meaningfully augment cognition. You're seeking something that transcends this paradigm.

2. **Integration of Spatial vs. Value-First Thinking**: Your request to pivot from spatial to value-first shows you're torn between two mental models of augmentation - one based on visual/spatial metaphors (which feel intuitive but may lack practical utility) and one based on immediate cognitive value (which feels less revolutionary but delivers immediate benefits).

3. **Modeling Intelligence Without Mimicking Humans**: Your exercise of simulating an engineer's workflow reveals that you're really interested in how AI can complement human thinking patterns rather than replicating them. You want something that works with our limitations rather than overwhelming us with its capabilities.

4. **Meta-Cognition Tools**: The System 3 concept itself (from your provided documents) is attempting to create an external system for thinking about thinking - a meta-cognitive layer. But you may be approaching this from a traditional software development mindset rather than a cognitive science one.

### How You May Be Misunderstanding Your Own Problem

1. **The Extension Paradox**: You're trying to extend human cognition through software, but the very act of using software creates cognitive overhead. The more powerful the extension, the greater the overhead, potentially negating its benefits. This is why simple tools often win over complex ones.

2. **The Interface Illusion**: You may be overestimating the importance of the interface (whether spatial or minimal) and underestimating the importance of the interaction model. The best cognitive extensions become invisible - they reshape how we think without us noticing them.

3. **The Knowledge vs. Wisdom Gap**: The System 3 concept attempts to bridge declarative knowledge (facts) with procedural knowledge (how to use facts). But what's missing is the third kind of knowledge - wisdom about when and why to apply knowledge. This is much harder to systematize.

4. **The Thinking About Thinking Trap**: By explicitly focusing on cognitive augmentation, you're making cognition itself the object of attention, which paradoxically can reduce cognitive capacity. The most powerful cognitive tools don't make us think about thinking - they just make thinking better.

### What Might Actually Work

Based on pattern recognition across domains:

1. **Ambient Intelligence Over Active Tools**: The most successful cognitive extensions throughout history haven't been active tools but ambient environments that shape thinking without requiring active engagement. Writing shaped thought not just through its use but by creating a culture of literacy.

2. **Evolving With Use**: The tools that most profoundly augment human cognition grow with their users - they start simple and gain complexity through use rather than being complex from the beginning.

3. **Connecting Rather Than Containing**: Rather than trying to build a tool that contains thoughts, what if it instead focused on connecting thoughts across contexts? The value of tools like Roam Research and Obsidian isn't in storing information but in revealing non-obvious connections.

4. **Process Over Product**: The most valuable cognitive augmentation often comes not from the tool itself but from the process of learning to use it. The act of learning Vim itself permanently changes how programmers think about text editing.

### A Different Approach

Perhaps what you're really looking for isn't a Neovim extension at all, but a new interaction model with code itself - one where code becomes a living medium that is both the thing being created and the environment for creation.

Instead of an extension that augments a text editor, what about rethinking the very notion of what code is and how we interact with it? What if code wasn't text at all, but something else entirely that better maps to our cognitive structures?

This is more aligned with the deeper vision of System 3 as described in your documents - not just tools for thinking, but entirely new environments for thought.
